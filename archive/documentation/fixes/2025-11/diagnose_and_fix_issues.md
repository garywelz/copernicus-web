# Diagnose and Fix All Issues

## Issue 1: Missing Podcasts (64 → 61)

Need to find:
- Podcasts using job IDs instead of canonical filenames
- Podcasts with UUID GUIDs
- The "Parkinson's Disease" podcast that disappeared

## Issue 2: YouTube Audio Corruption (6 podcasts)

Failed episodes:
1. "Quantum Computing Advances"
2. "Silicon compounds"
3. "Quantum Computing chip advances"
4. "Prime Number Theory update"
5. "New materials created using AI"
6. "Matrix Multiplication advances"

These need:
- Audio file integrity check
- Re-generation if corrupt
- RSS feed update
