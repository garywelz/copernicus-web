# Podcast Generation System Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed 5 critical issues in the podcast generation system on **January 31, 2025**.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Endpoint Confusion Resolved
**Problem**: Cloud function was calling `/generate-legacy-podcast` while backend used `/generate-podcast`
**Solution**: 
- Modified `cloud-function/main.py` to call `/generate-podcast` directly
- Added proper request format conversion from legacy to new format
- Eliminated the complex legacy conversion process

**Files Changed**: `cloud-function/main.py`

### 2. ✅ Filename Numbering Fixed
**Problem**: Files overwriting instead of incrementing (ever-math-250034 → ever-math-250034)
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `get_next_filename()` function with race condition protection
- Added existence checking before assigning episode numbers
- Improved category mapping and episode number detection
- Added comprehensive debugging and fallback mechanisms

**Files Changed**: `cloud-run-backend/main_google.py`

### 3. ✅ Multi-Voice Audio Fixed
**Problem**: All characters voiced by same speaker despite explicit voice assignments
**Solution**:
- Enhanced content generation prompts to ensure proper speaker labels (HOST:, EXPERT:, QUESTIONER:)
- Improved script parsing in ElevenLabs service with better error detection
- Added detailed logging to identify when multi-voice parsing fails
- Ensured proper voice distribution (HOST: 30%, EXPERT: 50%, QUESTIONER: 20%)

**Files Changed**: 
- `cloud-run-backend/main_google.py` (content generation prompts)
- `cloud-run-backend/elevenlabs_voice_service.py` (script parsing)

### 4. ✅ Duration Extended
**Problem**: Content ~4-5 minutes instead of requested 10 minutes
**Solution**:
- Increased target word calculation from 150 to 180 words per minute
- Added 20% buffer for episodes 10+ minutes (total: 216 words/min for 10+ min episodes)
- Enhanced content generation prompts to request 12-20 substantial dialogue segments per speaker
- Updated default duration from 5 to 10 minutes
- Added specific requirements for detailed explanations and examples

**Files Changed**: `cloud-run-backend/main_google.py`

### 5. ✅ Logging Enhanced
**Problem**: Insufficient logging for debugging
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the content generation pipeline
- Enhanced debugging for filename generation, audio processing, and multi-voice parsing
- Added detailed job tracking and progress indicators
- Added script preview logging for troubleshooting

**Files Changed**: 
- `cloud-run-backend/main_google.py`
- `cloud-run-backend/elevenlabs_voice_service.py`

## 📊 Technical Details

### Voice Configuration
The system uses ElevenLabs with these voice assignments:
- **HOST**: Matilda (Professional female, voice ID: XrExE9yKIg1WjnnlVkGX)
- **EXPERT**: Gary (Knowledgeable male, voice ID: CeUM4KBxu8vyeYTJozSJ)  
- **QUESTIONER**: Bill (Curious male, voice ID: iiidtqDt9FBdT1vfBluA)

### Duration Calculation
```
Target Words = Duration (minutes) × 180 words/minute
If duration >= 10 minutes: Target Words × 1.2 (20% buffer)
```

### Filename Format
```
ever-{category}-{episode_number}
Categories: phys, compsci, bio, chem, math, eng, med, psych
Episode numbers: 6-digit padded (e.g., 250035)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `cloud-function/main.py` - Endpoint confusion fix
- ✅ `cloud-run-backend/main_google.py` - Duration, filename, logging fixes  
- ✅ `cloud-run-backend/elevenlabs_voice_service.py` - Multi-voice parsing fix

### Git Status:
- ✅ Changes committed to branch: `cursor/fix-podcast-generation-system-issues-a5f1`
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub: `github.com/garywelz/copernicus-web`

## 🎯 Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:

1. **Correct File Naming**: 
   - ever-math-250034 → ever-math-250035 → ever-math-250036 (incremental)

2. **Multi-Voice Audio**:
   - HOST sections: Matilda's voice (professional female)
   - EXPERT sections: Gary's voice (knowledgeable male)
   - QUESTIONER sections: Bill's voice (curious male)

3. **Proper Duration**:
   - 10-minute requests should generate ~10-12 minutes of content
   - More detailed explanations and examples

4. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Detailed job tracking in Cloud Run logs
   - Script parsing debug information
   - Filename generation debugging

## ⚠️ Notes

- RSS feed dates remain as original 2025 dates (episodes were actually published in 2025)
- System architecture: Form → Cloud Function → Cloud Run Backend → ElevenLabs TTS → GCS Storage
- Main backend file in production: `main_google.py` (confirmed via Dockerfile)

## 📞 Support

If issues persist after deployment:
1. Check Cloud Run logs for enhanced debugging output
2. Verify ElevenLabs API key is properly configured
3. Test with a simple request first to isolate issues
4. Monitor filename generation in GCS bucket for incremental numbering
