## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review Changes:**
   - Review the modified files in `/huggingface-space/`
   - Review the modified and new files in `/huggingface-space/programming-framework/`

2. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/gdubs/copernicus-web-public/huggingface-space
   git add .
   git commit -m "Enhanced CopernicusAI and Programming Framework spaces for Nature reviewers

   - Added Abstract/Summary sections to both spaces
   - Added Methodological Details section to CopernicusAI
   - Added Data Availability Statement to CopernicusAI
   - Added Limitations & Future Directions section
   - Enhanced citations with BibTeX format
   - Fixed broken links: replaced mathematics database table with mathematics_index.html
   - Copied all index and batch HTML files from progframe (43 files total)
   - Enhanced Biology section with GLMP Database Table link
   - Improved link security and accessibility

   ```

3. **Push to Hugging Face:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   # Or if using Hugging Face Space remote:
   git push huggingface main
   ```

4. **Verify on Hugging Face:**
   - Check that all links work: https://huggingface.co/spaces/garywelz/copernicusai
   - Check Programming Framework: https://huggingface.co/spaces/garywelz/programming_framework
   - Verify all batch links are accessible
   - Test mathematics_index.html link
