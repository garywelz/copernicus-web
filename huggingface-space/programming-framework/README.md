# 🛠️ The Programming Framework

A Universal Method for Process Analysis

## 🎯 Overview

The Programming Framework is a **meta-tool**—a tool for creating tools. It provides a systematic method for analyzing any complex process by combining the analytical power of Large Language Models with the clarity of visual flowcharts.

## 💡 The Core Idea

**Problem:** Complex processes are difficult to understand because they involve many steps, decision points, and interactions. Traditional text descriptions are hard to follow.

**Solution:** Use LLMs to extract process logic from literature, then encode it as Mermaid flowcharts stored in JSON. Result: Clear, interactive visualizations that reveal hidden patterns and enable systematic analysis.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input Process** - Provide scientific papers, documentation, or process descriptions
2. **LLM Analysis** - AI extracts steps, decisions, branches, and logic flow
3. **Generate Flowchart** - Create Mermaid diagram encoded as JSON structure
4. **Visualize & Iterate** - Interactive flowchart reveals insights and enables refinement

## 🌍 Core Principles

### Domain Agnostic
Works across any field: biology, chemistry, software engineering, business processes, legal workflows, manufacturing, and beyond.

### Iterative Refinement
Start with rough analysis, visualize, identify gaps, refine with LLM, repeat until the process logic is crystal clear.

### Structured Data
JSON storage enables programmatic access, version control, cross-referencing, and integration with other tools and databases.

## 🚀 Applications

### 🧬 GLMP - Genome Logic Modeling (Live)
First specialized application: visualizing biochemical processes like DNA replication, metabolic pathways, and cell signaling.

### 💻 Software Architecture Analysis (Coming Soon)
Map complex software systems, API flows, and data pipelines as flowcharts for better documentation and understanding.

### 🏢 Business Process Modeling (In Development)
Analyze organizational workflows, decision trees, and operational procedures for optimization and automation.

### ⚛️ Physics & Engineering (Planned)
Model physical processes, engineering systems, and experimental protocols with step-by-step visual clarity.
