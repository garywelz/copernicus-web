# Prior Work Updates for NSF/DOE Grant Proposals

## Overview
Both Hugging Face spaces have been updated to be suitable for citation as "Prior Work" in National Science Foundation (NSF) and Department of Energy (DOE) funding proposals.

## Updated Files

### 1. CopernicusAI Space
- **README.md**: Added comprehensive "Prior Work & Research Contributions" section
- **index.html**: Added visual "Prior Work & Research Contributions" section with citation information

### 2. GLMP Space
- **README.md**: Added comprehensive "Prior Work & Research Contributions" section
- **index.html**: Added visual "Prior Work & Research Contributions" section with citation information

## Key Additions

### Prior Work Sections
Both spaces now include:
1. **Overview** - Clear statement that this represents prior work establishing foundation for the Knowledge Engine
2. **Research Contributions** - Detailed list of technical and research achievements
3. **Technical Achievements** - Specific metrics and deployment information
4. **Position Within CopernicusAI Knowledge Engine** - How each component fits into the larger framework
5. **Academic & Research Impact** - Research applications and contributions
6. **Citation Information** - Proper citation format for grant proposals

### Citation Formats

**CopernicusAI:**
```

## How to Use in Grant Proposals

### For NSF Proposals
- Cite as prior work demonstrating:
  - Research infrastructure development
  - AI-powered scientific knowledge synthesis
  - Collaborative research platform capabilities
  - Integration of multiple knowledge engine components

### For DOE Proposals
- Cite as prior work demonstrating:
  - Scientific computing and data science capabilities
  - Large-scale data integration (250+ million papers)
  - Multi-model LLM architecture
  - Scalable cloud infrastructure

## Knowledge Engine Components Referenced

Both spaces now clearly position work within the larger CopernicusAI Knowledge Engine:

1. **Research Paper Metadata Database** (Phase 2)
2. **Science Video Database**
3. **Programming Framework**
4. **GLMP** (Genome Logic Modeling Project)
5. **AI Podcast Generation** (CopernicusAI platform)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Updates**: Upload the updated files to both Hugging Face spaces
2. **Review Citations**: Verify citation formats match your proposal requirements
3. **Add to Proposals**: Reference these spaces in your NSF/DOE grant applications
4. **Link Components**: Ensure proposals clearly show how these prior work components support the broader Knowledge Engine goals

## Deployment Instructions

See `DEPLOY_ALL_SPACES.md` for detailed deployment instructions.
